# Generative-Dog-Images-WGAN-GP

## Overview

This project involves the use of Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) to generate realistic images of dogs. The project was inspired by a Kaggle competition focused on generative models and their potential for data augmentation and beyond.

## Description

This project involves training a generative model to create images of dogs. The images generated by the model are evaluated based on how well they are classified as dogs by pre-trained neural networks. The project leverages the capabilities of GANs to produce eerily lifelike images, contributing to the advancement of generative image creation.

## Key Concepts

- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** A class of machine learning systems where two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, compete against each other to create realistic data.
- **Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP):** An improved version of GAN that helps stabilize training and generate higher-quality images by penalizing the gradient norm.

## Implementation Details

The project uses the WGAN-GP architecture to generate dog images. The training process involves:
1. **Data Preparation:** Loading and preprocessing dog images.
2. **Model Architecture:** Defining the generator and discriminator networks.
3. **Training:** Using the WGAN-GP framework to train the models, ensuring stable and efficient training.
4. **Evaluation:** Periodically generating and displaying images to evaluate the quality and realism of the generated dog images.

## Results
The project successfully generated realistic images of dogs. Example images can be found in the `select-images` directory.
